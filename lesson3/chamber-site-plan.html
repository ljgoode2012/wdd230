        <h1>Community Chamber of Commerce Site Plan</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to provide members of the community with the information about the community, contact information, information about the chamber of commerce members, as well as provide a place for prospective members to fill out a form and join the chamber of commerce. Ultimately this site will further the chamber’s goals of connecting with the community and supporting local businesses.</p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>Grace is a manager of a well known big chain store located in the community. She needs to improve the store’s relationship with the local community. As a member of the chamber, she goes on the website, scrolls to the bottom of the homepage and clicks on the contact information page. She finds the contact information and reaches out to the appropriate person to discuss sponsorship opportunities for future events.</p>
        <p>Jorge is a local small business owner. He needs help increasing his business’s presence in the community. He gets on the website and sees the “join” button in the hero image. He clicks on it and is taken to a page that explains the benefits of joining the chamber of commerce and presents the form for joining. He fills out the form and clicks submit. Jorge has found a simple way to join the chamber and receive support for his business.</p>
