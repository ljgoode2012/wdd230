            <section>
                <h4>Tynker</h4>

            <p>With a large white heading that is significantly larger than any other text, your
                eyes immediately read Tynker's most important message. Their product is easy coding skills development for
                kids. Next, the bright orange button pulls your attention, offering you an action to take,
                with the message that it is free to try. Finally, the small text in conjunction with the 
                image of the game, sends the message that the product is fun to play. Using the design principle 
                of visual hierarchy, Tynker effectively takes your eyes through a journey that informs you their 
                product is easy, free, and fun.

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

                <h4>Chase</h4>
                <a href="https://www.chase.com">Chase.com</a>

            <p>The Chase website opens with a clean, simple menu of options. The bank offers
                such a variety of services and products, many of which the average user may not understand.
                Without good organization it would be easy to get lost in them. Using Hick's law, the designers 
                have simplified Chase's services and products into categories that are easy to understand with icons 
                that help the categories become more user friendly.

            <p>Although the term "white space" in web design doesn't have to actually be the color white,
                Progressive does a particularly good job of using white to create a unique clean experience
                for their customers. On their website they use the white space to streamline the content and
                allow your eyes to focus on one thing at a time. This creates a very clean and easy reading
                and scrolling experience. It also allows their logo and brand to have a very strong presence
                without being overshadowed or muted by other messages.
